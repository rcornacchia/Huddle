#Group checks made easy


001     Customer arrives at restaurant  
002     Waiter takes their order on an ipad  
003     The meal progress as normal. Drinks -> Appetizers -> Entrees -> Dessert
004     Instead of bringing out a check, the waiter brings out an ipad with the bill on it.  
005     Food objects can be split by person. Simply tap what you want, and checkout with venmo or credit card.  
006     If a customer prefers, they can take out their phone and open our app. The geotag will sync with the app, so we know they're in the restaurant. They can tap and pay just like the waiter's ipad.
